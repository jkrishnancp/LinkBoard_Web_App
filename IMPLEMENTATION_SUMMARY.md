---

### 8. Browser Extension ❌
**Status:** Not Implemented

**Why Not Implemented:**
1. Requires separate extension project (manifest v3)
2. Different build process for each browser
3. Complex permission management
4. Would need backend for sync (contradicts localStorage approach)
5. Beyond scope of single-app implementation

**Alternative Solution:**
- Use bookmarklet for quick adds
- Use bulk import for existing bookmarks
- PWA provides similar quick access

**Effort Required:** 40+ hours for full implementation

---

- Responsive grid: `{ lg: 12, md: 12, sm: 6, xs: 4, xxs: 2 }`
- Touch-friendly buttons and controls
- Mobile-optimized search and filters
- Swipe-friendly layout

**Why PWA Instead of Native:**

## 🎓 Technical Decisions

### Why localStorage Instead of Database?
**User's Explicit Request:** "i dont need supabase i need the localdb"
- Privacy first (data never leaves browser)
- Zero setup required
- Instant start
- No backend costs
- Offline by default

### Why PWA Instead of Native Mobile?
- 100% feature parity
- Single codebase
- Instant updates
- Cross-platform
- No app store friction

### Why No Browser Extension?
- Requires separate project
- Different permissions model
- Would need backend for sync
- Beyond localStorage scope
- PWA provides similar UX

### Architecture Choices
- **Zustand:** Lightweight state management
- **localStorage:** Simple, reliable persistence
- **TypeScript:** Type safety
- **shadcn/ui:** Consistent components
- **Next.js 13:** Modern React framework
- **Service Worker:** Offline-first PWA

---

## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

### Limitations
1. **Storage:** ~5-10MB browser limit (sufficient for 500+ links)
2. **Sync:** Manual export/import only
3. **Extension:** Not available (use bookmarklet)
4. **Icons:** Placeholders need replacement
5. **Mobile Keyboard:** Some shortcuts don't work on touch devices

### Not Issues (By Design)
- No real-time sync (localStorage architecture)
- No backend (privacy first)
- No cloud storage (optional future)
- No native apps (PWA sufficient)
